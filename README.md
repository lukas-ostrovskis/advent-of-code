# Advent of Code
My solutions to the fun annual coding challenge [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). I will update the repository occasionally with new solutions to this challenge.
## Advent of Code 2020
To challenge myself, I am going to solve every problem in Python. Since it's the first time I'll use Python, the challenge lies both in learning a new programming language and actually solving these coding problems with it.

Current progress: ```33/50``` stars


## Project goals
- Have fun solving interesting coding challenges
- Achieve all 300 stars
